# 1.8.1 release notes

This is a backport release which backports features originally intended for
slack-2.0 release.  This is meant as a nice fix for people missing critical
bugs.  Thanks [@Nooba](https://github.com/Nooba/) for taking the time to
backport all of the changes.  Since new features listed here will also be
included in the slack-2.0 release I'm not going to bother mentioning them in the
slack-2.0 release at all.

New Features:

* Allow simple markup formatting in custom messages. (#127)

UI Improvements:

* Improves custom message help text. (#97)

Bug fixes:

* Allow parallel builds. (#122)
* Use textarea for customMessage.  This allows custom messages to have new
  lines. (#103)
* Set test connection message color correctly. (#101)
* Fix publish to multiple rooms. Add unit tests. (#98, #100)
* Include custom message when changes are found. (#95)

* The separator for specifying posting to multiple slack channels is more

  plugin.  This includes the folder and the project in the notification (#61)

  reversed when saving settings in the UI (#63)
